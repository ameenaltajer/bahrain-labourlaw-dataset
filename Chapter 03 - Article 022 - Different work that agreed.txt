Article 22

It is prohibited for the employer to deviate from the terms agreed upon in the individual work contract or the collective work contract, or to assign the worker to work other than that agreed upon, unless necessity calls for it to prevent an accident, or repair what has resulted from it, or in the case of force majeure, provided that this is done in a temporary capacity.

The employer may assign the worker to work other than that agreed upon, if it is not fundamentally different from their original work and provided that the rights of the worker are not prejudiced. The employer may train and prepare the worker to perform a work different from the work agreed upon in line with the technological development in the establishment, provided that ministry and the relevant union organization are informed.

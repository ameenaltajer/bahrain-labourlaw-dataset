Article 81

If an employee is accused of committing a crime or misdemeanor that violates honor, trustworthiness, public morals, or commits a misdemeanor within the workplace, the employer may temporarily suspend the employee until a decision is issued by the public prosecutor's office. If the public prosecutor's office decides to drop the investigation or orders the dismissal of the criminal case, or if the competent court acquits the employee for reasons related to denying the crime, the employee must be reinstated to work. If it is proven that the accusation against the employee was fabricated by the employer or his representative, the employee must be paid his salary for the suspension period. If this is proven to both the public prosecutor's office and the competent court, they must indicate it in their decision or judgment.

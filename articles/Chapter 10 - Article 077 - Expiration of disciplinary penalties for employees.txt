Article 77

Disciplinary penalties imposed on employees expire after the following periods:

A) Six months in the case of written warning and verbal warning.

B) One year in the case of suspension from work with deduction from the salary, delaying the annual bonus payment, and delaying promotion.

The expiration of these penalties can occur if it becomes evident that the employee's behavior and job performance are satisfactory. The lifting of the penalty is treated as if it never happened in the future. The penalty documents and any reference to them are removed from the employee's file.

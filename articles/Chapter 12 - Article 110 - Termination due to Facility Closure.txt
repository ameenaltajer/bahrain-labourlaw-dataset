Article 110

The employer may terminate the employment contract due to the complete or partial closure of the facility, the reduction of its activity, or the replacement of the production system with another that affects the workforce, provided that the worker is notified of the termination date. The termination of the contract shall not be made until the ministry is notified of the termination 30 days prior, except in the case of the total closure of the facility. The termination of the Bahraini worker's contract, who has the same competence and experience as the foreign worker working with him in the facility, shall be avoided.

In the event of termination of the contract for any of the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph, the worker is entitled to a reward equivalent to half the compensation referred to in Article (111) of this law.

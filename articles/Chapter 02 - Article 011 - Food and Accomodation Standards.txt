Article 11

An employer who employs workers in remote areas that are to be determined by a decision of the Minister is obligated to provide them with the necessary appropriate meals and adequate housing and accomodation.

The Minister, after taking the opinion of the concerned ministries, the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions, issues decrees for the housing specifications, the types and quantities of food that are provided to the worker for each meal, and the monetary consideration paid by the employer in exchange for it.

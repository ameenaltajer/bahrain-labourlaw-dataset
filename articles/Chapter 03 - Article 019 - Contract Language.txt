Article 19

The employment contract must be established in writing and drawn up in Arabic in two copies, one copy for each party. If the contract was written in a language other than Arabic, one copy in Arabic shall be attached.

If the contract is referred to internal regulations, it must be attached to the work contract, and signed by both parties to the contract, and it is reliable as evidence. And in the absence of a written work contract, the worker alone may prove all his rights by all methods of proof.

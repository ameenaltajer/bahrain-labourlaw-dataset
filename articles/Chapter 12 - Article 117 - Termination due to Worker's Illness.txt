Article 117

The employer is not allowed to terminate the employment contract due to the worker's illness unless the worker has exhausted his sick and annual leave balance. The employer must notify the worker of his desire to terminate the contract fifteen days before the worker's sick leave is exhausted. If the worker recovers before the end of this period, the employer shall refrain from terminating the contract due to the worker's illness.

Article 35

After completing her maternity leave and until her child reaches the age of six months, the working woman shall have two care periods to breastfeed her child, provided that each period is not less than one hour. She is also entitled to two care periods of half an hour each until her child reaches his first year. These two additional periods are calculated from working hours and do not entail any reduction in wages.

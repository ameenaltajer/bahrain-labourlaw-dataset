Article 118

Any employment contract that the employer concludes with the same worker is considered one contract, provided that there is no time difference between the end of the old contract or the start of the new contract, or if this difference is less than 30 days. If the new contract includes better benefits or conditions, it is considered a violation of the previous employment contract.

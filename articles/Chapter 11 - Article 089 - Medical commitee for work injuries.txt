The Minister of Health, in agreement with the Minister, issues a decision to form a medical committee responsible for determining the following:

1) Whether the worker's illness or injury is work-related.
2) The level of disability suffered by the worker and the percentage of disability.
3) The end of the worker's treatment.
4) The resolution of any disputes over the duration and cost of treatment.

The decision to form this committee will also specify its procedures and operating system.

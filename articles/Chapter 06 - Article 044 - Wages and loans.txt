Article 44

a) The employer may not deduct more than 10% from the worker’s wages in order to fulfill the money he lent to him during the validity of the contract, or to charge interest on these loans, and this provision applies to wages paid in advance. However, with regard to housing construction loans, it is permissible to increase the percentage of deduction from the worker’s wages, not exceeding 25% of the wage, provided that the worker agrees in writing.

b) The employer may charge the worker the actual administrative expenses incurred by the loan, and the rules relating to payment of the loan shall apply to the worker loan.

c) If the worker leaves his job before paying the loan amount, the employer has the right to deduct the loan value or what is left of it from the worker's entitlements.

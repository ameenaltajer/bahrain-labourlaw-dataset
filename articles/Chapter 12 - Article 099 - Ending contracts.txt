Article 99

A. Each party to the contract may terminate it after notifying the other party at least thirty days prior to termination, and the employment contract remains in effect during the notice period, and both parties are obliged to fulfill all obligations arising from it. If the contract is terminated by the employer, it is permissible to agree that the notice period exceeds thirty days.

B. If the contract is terminated without taking into account the notice period, the party that terminated the contract is obliged to compensate the other party for this period, equal to the worker's wage for the entire period or what remains of it, depending on the circumstances. If the termination is by the employer, the notice period or what remains of it is calculated within the worker's period of service, and if the termination is by the worker, the contract ends from the time the worker leaves the job.

C. If the notice of termination of the contract is by the employer, the worker has the right to be absent from work for a whole day a week or for eight hours during the week to look for another job, provided that the absence is at an appropriate time for work conditions, and the worker is entitled to his wage for the day or hours of absence.

D. The provisions of this article do not prejudice the right of either party to claim compensation for the termination of the contract if necessary.

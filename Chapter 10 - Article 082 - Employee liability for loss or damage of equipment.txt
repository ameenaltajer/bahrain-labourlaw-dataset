Article 82

If an employee, during the course of their work, causes the loss or damage of tools, equipment, or products owned by the employer or in their custody, as a result of intentional misconduct or gross negligence, the employee is obliged to pay the value of what was lost or damaged.

After an investigation and notifying the employee, the employer is entitled to deduct the mentioned amount from the employee's salary, provided that the deduction does not exceed the salary of five days per month.

The employee may appeal the employer's assessment before the competent court within one month of being notified of this assessment. If the court does not rule in favor of the employer or rules for a lower amount, the employer must return what was deducted without justification within seven days from the date of the final ruling.

The employer is not allowed to recover the value of what was lost or damaged by deducting it from the employee's salary if this value exceeds two months' salary.

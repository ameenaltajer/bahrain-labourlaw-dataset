Article 64

The worker has the right to a full paid holiday on public holidays and official occasions, as determined by a decision from the Council of Ministers based on the minister's proposal. The employer may operate the worker on any of these days if work circumstances require it, and in this case, the worker is entitled to his salary for this day and an additional 150% of this salary, or another day off of his choice as compensation for the additional pay or holiday. If any of these days coincides with Friday or an official holiday, the worker is compensated with another day.

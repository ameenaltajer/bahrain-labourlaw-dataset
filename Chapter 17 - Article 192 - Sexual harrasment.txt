Article 192

If a worker sexually harasses another worker while on the job, they may be sent to jail for up to one year or have to pay a fine of up to 100 dinars.

However, if the person committing the harassment is the employer or acting on behalf of the employer, the punishment is more severe: at least six months in jail or a fine of 500 to 1,000 dinars.

Article 116

Gratuity is a monetary payment eligible to an employee as a lump sum at the end of his tenure provided that the period of service exceeds one year. Gratuity payment is a liability to the employer which accrues as the employee service period progresses.

The employees that are entitled to a gratuity are expatriate workers on the completion of their contract. Social insurance law applies to nationals employed in Bahrain and they are not entitled to gratuity.

This is calculated on the basis of the worker’s most recent basic wage in addition to social allowance, if any.

Also to accrue gratuity, the number of days is: 15 days’ wages for each year of the first three years of service and one-month wage for each year of service thereafter. The following example shows the gratuity accrual at a given time.

Article 105

The worker may terminate the employment contract without notice in either of the following two cases:

1- If the employer or his representative assaults the worker during or because of work, by word or deed punishable by law.
2- If the employer or his representative commits an indecent act towards the worker or one of his family members.

Termination of the contract in these two cases is considered arbitrary dismissal by the employer.

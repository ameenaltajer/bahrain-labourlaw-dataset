Article 67

A Muslim worker who has spent five consecutive years in the service of the employer has the right to a paid leave of fourteen working days to perform the Hajj. This leave is granted to the worker once during his service period, unless he has benefited from it with another employer.

The employer determines the number of workers who are granted this leave annually, according to work requirements, provided that priority is given to the worker who has spent the longest continuous period of service.

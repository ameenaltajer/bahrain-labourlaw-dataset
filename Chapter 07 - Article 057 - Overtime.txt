Article 57

a) Work in the establishment must be organized so that every worker gets a weekly rest of no less than twenty-four full hours. Friday is considered a weekly rest day, and taking into account the Friday prayer time for Muslims, the employer may replace this day for some of his workers with any other day of the week.

The employer may grant the worker a paid weekly rest for a period of more than twenty-four consecutive hours, provided that the working hours per week do not exceed forty-eight hours.

b) The employer may employ the worker on his weekly rest day if work conditions so require, and in this case the worker shall be entitled to his wage for this day of equivalent to 150% of this wage, or another day is granted in its place, according to the workerâ€™s choice of overtime or leave.

The worker may not be employed on the weekly rest day more than twice in a row, except with his written consent.

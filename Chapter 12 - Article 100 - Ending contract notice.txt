The party who wishes to terminate the contract must deliver the notice to the other party or their representative and obtain a signature of receipt. If the other party refuses to accept the notice, the party wishing to terminate the contract may prove it by any means of evidence.

The notice period starts from the date of receipt of the notice or the date of refusal of receipt, depending on the circumstances. The notice cannot be suspended on a condition that is standing or void.

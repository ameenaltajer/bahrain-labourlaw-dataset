Article 73

If the work performed by the worker allows him to get acquainted with the clients of the employer or to have access to work secrets, the two parties may agree that it is not permissible After the termination of the contract, the worker may compete with the employer, and may not participate in any project that competes with him. However, for the validity of this agreement, the following is required:

1) That the worker has completed eighteen years of age at the time of concluding the contract.
2) That the restriction be limited in terms of time to a period not exceeding one year following the termination of the work contract, and limited in terms of place and type of work to the extent necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the employer.

It is not permissible for the employer to adhere to this agreement if he terminates the contract or refuses to renew it without the worker having something that justifies that, just as he is not allowed to adhere to this agreement if he signed something that justifies the workerâ€™s termination of the contract.

When an employer needs to downsize or make redundancies, then the employer must notify the Ministry of Labour at least 30 days before the employees are served with their notice of termination.

In a recent significant change to the redundancy procedures, Article 110 was amended to distinguish between Bahraini and expatriate employees. It now favors Bahraini employees, as the law states that in events of redundancy, if the experience and competency of the Bahraini worker match the experience of the expatriate employee, then the employer is required, by law, to retain the Bahraini employee. If the employer terminates the Bahraini employee's employment contract, the termination will be deemed unlawful, and may entitle the employee to file a claim against the employer.

Termination due to downsizing will not be considered unlawful if (1) the procedure is complied with (2) the downsizing is for legitimate reasons, and (3) the employer has acted in good faith. 

A redundant employee is still entitled to compensation, but it is half the amount that would be due if the termination was unlawful or unjustified.
